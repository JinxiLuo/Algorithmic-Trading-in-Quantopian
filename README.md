# Algorithmic-Trading-with-Python

**Themes**: Algorithmic Trading, Choosing Alpha Factors, Back Testing and Data Analysis

### Project Summary

The inspiration of this project comes from sentdex's "Python Programming for Finance" video series. Thus, code and procedures may be similar.
A lot of the project is still underway and unclear due to the shutdown of Quantopian which made it harder to perform back testing and alpha factor selection. I am currently experimenting with using Zipline and web scraping to obtain stock and business data from different sources to achieve the same goal.
